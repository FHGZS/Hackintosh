# Hackintosh
## Mac OS X on PC

### This repository contains drivers and tools you need to install Mac OS X on your Windows PC.

My PC Config: Samsung 450r5j (Intel-i5-haswell HD4400 nVidia820(no driver) SynapticsTouchPad)  
If your PC hardware is similar to mine, you may try this entire collecion. But I do not promise your success.  

### The drivers in this repo has all been customized! If there is a same file in S/L/E, REPLACE it!

Notice:
 - Configuring Hackintosh on PC need far more time than configuring Linux, So **Keep Patient**.
 - AMD CPU Users usually have little luck on Hackintosh
 - **DSDT injection may not work on a different hardware**, so use with caution.
 - Even if your laptop is exactly same as mine, you are still likely to fail on boot.
 - The HD4400 driver works **only on 10.10.5**
 - This repo is large, so **'Download ZIP' is recommended.**
 - Hackintosh is just a technical proof of my understanding of OS X and Unix, and
 - **I will not take any responsibility for any loss or damage caused by this collection.**
