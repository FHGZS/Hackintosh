# Hackintosh
Mac OS X on PC

This repository contains most drivers and tools you need to install Mac OS X on your Windows PC.

My PC Config: Samsung 450r5j (Intel-i5-haswell HD4400 nVidia820(no driver) SynapticsTouchPad)  
If your PC hardware is similar to mine, you may try this entire collecion. But I do not promise your success.  

Notice:
 - Configuring Hackintosh on PC need far more time than configuring Linux, So Keep Patient.
 - AMD CPU Users usually have little luck on Hackintosh
 - Even if your laptop is exactly same as mine, you are still likely to fail on boot.
 - Hackintosh is just a technical prove of my understanding of Mac OS and
 - I will not take any responsibility for any loss or damaged caused by this collection.
  
Enjoy Hackintosh!
